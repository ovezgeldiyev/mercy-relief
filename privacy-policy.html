                        <br> <br>

                        This website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google Inc. (“Google”).
                        Google Analytics works using cookies.
                        <br> <br>

                        Google Analytics cookies collect your IP address, however because IP anonymisation is used on
                        this website, your IP address will be shortened (and therefore anonymised) as soon as
                        technically possible and before it is stored or otherwise used in connection with Google
                        Analytics.
                        <br> <br>

                        The anonymisation process takes place within the European Union or the European Economic Area,
                        except in exceptional cases, where your full IP address may be sent to a Google server in the
                        USA and shortened there.
                        <br> <br>

                        We use the information collected by Google Analytics cookies to find out about how visitors use
                        our website.
                        <br> <br>

                        The IP address sent by your browser in connection with Google Analytics will not be combined by
                        Google, with other data.
                        <br> <br>

                        You can prevent Google Analytics cookies from being stored by setting your browser software
                        accordingly (see our cookie policy for further information). However, please note that you may
                        not then be able to make full use of all the website’s functions.
                        <br> <br>

                        You can also opt-out of Google Analytics by downloading and installing the browser plug-in
                        available at the following link:

                        Where we do this for joint events, we do it for the purpose of removing duplicates from our

                        organisation of a regular event to another organisation and we or the new organiser will contact
                        you at that time to let you know. We will never share your confidential matter or enquiry
